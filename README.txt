This is a fork from mrob27's Portal Gun mod for Minetest, all I added was a crafting recipe for the Gun, Making it possible to create this item in survival!

I am not very experensed with coding, especially in lua. So I just copy and pasted, then changed to my will from the following link:
  rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/en/items/nodes_items_crafting.html#crafting

I don't know the standards of posting mods to the minetest mod github, or even to the contentDB to make it avalible for easier download, but if anybody knows, I'd love to know (I've been think of making a mod of my own ;))!

I used the unified inventory to show the crafting recipe because I was to lazy to create a new world (I was playing a massivly modded world at the time) so I just just used Windows's (Window's, Windows'?) built-in Snipping Tool to make the image you can find in the master folder
