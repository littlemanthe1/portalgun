This is a fork from mrob27's Portal Gun mod for Minetest, all I added was a crafting recipe for the Gun, Making it possible to create this item in survival!

I am not very experensed with coding, especially in lua. So I just copy and pasted, then changed to my will from the following link:
  https://rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/en/index.html

I don't know the standards of posting mods to the minetest mod github, or even to the contentDB to make it avalible for easier download, but if anybody knows, I'd love to know (I've been think of making a mod of my own ;))!
